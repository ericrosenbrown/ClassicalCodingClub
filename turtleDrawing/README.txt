turtle is a python library that allows you to draw using a pen called turtle. You can imagine the turtle like a pen on a piece of paper. Wherever the turtle goes, a line may be drawn below him. Using commands like move forward and turning, you can make complex art. A more in-depth tutorial, that is easy to follow, can be found here (This is where the code examples in our project come from): https://michael0x2a.com/blog/turtle-examples
