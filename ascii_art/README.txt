Mac: https://blog.artooro.com/2013/01/04/how-to-install-pil-python-imaging-library-on-mac-os-x-10-8/

HOW TO USE:
1) Download the .zip from github and open up bitMapper.py inside of ascii_art. Once you have this file, you can run the program by saving the code, and then running the following command in IDLE, where path_to_file is the name of the file path to the photo you want to convert:

ASCIIart().main(path_to_file).

This will save the resulting image in a .txt file.
