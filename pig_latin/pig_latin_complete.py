#by clicking "Run" in the toolbar, and selecting "Run Module"

#You should be able to do stuff like:
    #print toPigLatin("pardon")   --> prints out "ardonpay"

#If you have more time, try adding new rules using more else if statements.
    #This function isn't perfect.
    #For example, with this function, toPigLatin("school") --> returns "choolsay"
        #when perhaps we'd want it to return "oolschay"
